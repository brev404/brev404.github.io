Driven and enthusiastic engineering student with an interest in technology, history and nonsensical quotes.
Loved building robots & creating connections in the [First Tech Challenge](https://natieprineducatie.ro/) competition.
Writing technical documentation, thinking modular and team management are fun. Breaking stuff is even more fun.
